# MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error in MongoDB aggregation pipelines that leads to unexpected results.  The issue stems from an incorrectly structured pipeline that leads to inaccurate counting and sorting of grouped documents.

## Problem Description
The provided `bug.js` file contains an aggregation pipeline intended to count the occurrences of a specific field, sort the results in descending order based on the count, and limit the output to the top 10.  However, due to potential errors in the `$match`, `$group`, `$sort`, or `$limit` stages, the pipeline yields incorrect or unexpected results.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file offers a corrected aggregation pipeline that accurately counts, sorts, and limits the results.  The solution may involve fixing typos in field names, adding or removing stages, or adjusting the logic within the stages to properly handle the aggregation process.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Create a MongoDB collection with sample data.
3. Run `bug.js` to see the erroneous aggregation results.
4. Run `bugSolution.js` to observe the correct aggregation results.
